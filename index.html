    <h1>Portfolio Inspiration</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>I specifically like how illustrative the first profolio is. Although it doesn't have too much user interaction, the profolio openly broadcasts the talent of the artist</p>

    <p>The second website is interactive and I <b><i>really</i></b> like how they used negative space to createt their pieces  as well as having htte eyes of the figures following a shape. It's a definite attention grabber and that's what makes it my favorite.</p>

    <p>The third porfolio is more of an image based website with a lot of animative effects. Hovering over each line of text automatically has images of that project pop up. I just like how clean and professional it looks. Also, the light peach color really sets the tone of the soft and elegant photos.</p>
